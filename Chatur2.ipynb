The suggested mitigation plan was to form a dedicated group for taking PESO approval complying with all the OISD requirements, to use Short Controlled Area Radiography (SCAR) such as Saferad® during shutdowns to avoid interruption of work due to radiography, to introduce special conditions for delivery of exotic materials and payment terms during tendering, to select and introduce the isotope for radiography at the tendering stage depending upon the criticality/thickness of material, to issue change orders to take care of remote assistance,\n"

Weekly progress reports should also be furnished in each case. IOCL should also ensure that the scope of supply is frozen prior to tendering and that budgetary quotes are obtained from potential bidders. Furthermore, IOCL should agree on the supply of proprietary items with the licensor to enable better control and monitoring of the project. IOCL should also consider diversifying contractors and bringing in more competition to improve the performance of local contractors. Additionally, IOCL should ensure that all modifications to approved drawings are approved by PESO before work is executed, and that dedicated groups are formed to take PESO approval in compliance with OISD requirements. IOCL should also consider using Short Controlled Area Radiography (SCAR) such as Saferad® during shutdowns of DHDS to avoid interruption of work due to radiography.
